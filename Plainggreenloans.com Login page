When you need money fast, your first thought might be to take a cash advance from your credit card. It's quick and easy, and your card issuer may seem to be begging you to borrow by sending you offers and blank checks. Still, cash advances can be expensive, so before going this route, be sure you consider alternatives like a loan from friends or family, a 401(k) loan, a Roth IRA withdrawal, a personal loan from a bank or other lender, a secured loan, a salary advance, a peer-to-peer loan, or a buy now, pay later service.
