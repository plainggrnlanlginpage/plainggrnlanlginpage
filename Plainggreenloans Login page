 A credit card cash advance is a loan from your credit card issuer. As with your everyday purchases, the cash advance will appear as a transaction on your monthly card statement.

However, the terms for cash advances are different from those of purchasesâ€”and not in your favor. There usually is no grace period for cash advances; interest starts accumulating from the date of the transaction. Additionally, the interest rate is usually higher for cash advances than for purchases.
